### Creating an Evaluation Scorecard

To systematically compare AI tools, create a standardized scorecard with categories that matter most for your context. Here's a template to adapt:

| Category | Weight | Tool A | Tool B | Tool C |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Code quality | 20% | 4/5 | 3/5 | 5/5 |
| Domain knowledge | 15% | 3/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| Technical integration | 15% | 5/5 | 4/5 | 2/5 |
| Security & privacy | 20% | 5/5 | 2/5 | 4/5 |
| Cost effectiveness | 15% | 3/5 | 5/5 | 2/5 |
| Documentation & support | 15% | 4/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 |
| **Weighted score** | **100%** | **4.0** | **3.6** | **3.65** |

Adjust the weights based on your specific priorities and constraints.

### Effective Prompt Engineering for Data Science

Regardless of which AI tool you select, effective prompt engineering is critical for getting the best results. Here are data science-specific strategies:

#### Specifying Context and Goals

Always provide:

1. **The overall goal** of your data science task
2. **The specific stage** in your workflow
3. **Relevant context** about your data and domain
4. **Expected output format** or requirements

For example, instead of:
```
How do I handle missing values in my dataset?
```

Try:
```
I'm working on a healthcare dataset with patient readmission information. 
The dataset has 20% missing values in the 'length_of_stay' column which is 
numeric and represents days in hospital. Other columns have less than 5% 
missing values. This is for a logistic regression model predicting 30-day 
readmission. What are appropriate strategies for handling these missing values, 
considering I need to maintain the statistical validity of the model?
```

#### Using Clear Input/Output Examples

Provide examples of your expected format to guide the AI tool:

```
Generate a function to clean categorical variables in a pandas DataFrame.
The function should handle:
1. Missing values
2. Case normalization
3. Removal of extra whitespace
4. Consolidation of similar categories

Example input:
categories = ['High  ', 'high', 'HIGH', 'Medium', 'med', 'Low', np.nan, 'Unknown']

Expected output after processing:
['high', 'high', 'high', 'medium', 'medium', 'low', 'unknown', 'unknown']
```

This approach is particularly effective for code generation tasks.

#### Breaking Down Complex Problems

For complex data science tasks, use a step-by-step approach:

1. Ask the AI to outline an approach first
2. Review and refine the outline
3. Request implementation details for each step
4. Integrate the components into a complete solution

This creates a collaborative problem-solving process that leverages both AI suggestions and your domain expertise.

### Integrating AI Tools Into Your Workflow

Rather than treating AI tools as replacements for existing processes, consider strategic integration points:

#### Workflow Integration Points

#### Creating a Systematic Prompt Library

Organize a personal or team library of effective prompts for common data science tasks:

```
# Prompt Template: Data Cleaning

## Task Description
Generate code to clean the [Dataset Type] dataset focusing on [Specific Issues].

## Context
- Dataset has [Number] rows and [Number] columns

    ...
```
```

Customizing templates like this for different data science tasks creates a valuable resource that improves over time.

### AI As a Learning Tool, Not Just a Task Solver

Beyond solving immediate problems, AI tools can accelerate your learning as a data scientist:

#### Learning Strategies with AI

1. **Concept Explanation**
   - Ask for multiple metaphors or analogies for complex concepts
   - Request explanations at different levels of technical depth
   - Have the AI identify connections between concepts you're learning

2. **Code Understanding**
   - Ask the AI to explain unfamiliar code line by line
   - Request descriptions of why certain approaches were chosen
